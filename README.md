# astroworkshop
This is the website for the Astroworkshop of the Comenius University astronomy and astrophysics group,
organized annually at the Astrophysical and Geophysical Observatory in Modra-Piesok.

It is a small standalone project on which I tried to learn how to work with Django database abstraction layer.
Programmed by Martin Baláž, most of the graphics are by Daniela Bartková.
