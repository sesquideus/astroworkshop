# astroworkshop
This is the website for the Astroworkshop of the Comenius University astronomy and astrophysics group,
organized annually at the Astrophysical and Geophysical Observatory in Modra-Piesok.
It is a small standalone project on which I tried to learn how to work with Django database abstraction layer.

Programmed by [@sesquideus](https://github.com/sesquideus/), most of the graphics are by Daniela Bartkov√°.
